\begin{abstract}
These instructions give you guidelines for preparing papers for AIAA Technical Journals using \LaTeX{}. If you previously prepared an AIAA Conference Paper using the Meetings Papers Template, you may submit using the Meetings Papers Template so long as the text is double-spaced.  Carefully follow the journal paper submission process in Sec.~II of this document. Keep in mind that the electronic file you submit will be formatted further at AIAA. This first paragraph is formatted in the abstract style. Abstracts are required for regular, full-length papers and express articles. Be sure to define all symbols used in the abstract, and do not cite references in this section. The footnote on the first page should list the Job Title and AIAA Member Grade (if applicable) for each author.
