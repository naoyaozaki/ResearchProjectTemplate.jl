\section{General Guidelines}

The following section outlines general (nonformatting) guidelines to follow. These guidelines are applicable to all authors and include information on the policies and practices relevant to the publication of your manuscript.

\subsection{Publication by AIAA}
Your manuscript cannot be published by AIAA if:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The work is classified or has not been cleared for public release.
\item The work contains copyright-infringing material.
\item The work has been published or is currently under consideration for publication or presentation elsewhere. (Exception: Papers presented at AIAA conferences may be submitted to AIAA journals for possible publication.)
\end{enumerate}

You will be asked to provide the publication or presentation history of your paper (or any similar paper) if it has \emph{ever} been submitted for publication or presentation previously to an AIAA journal or conference. Please include the following, if applicable: the full name of the publication or conference, the entire paper number, dates the conference took place, review history, final disposition of manuscript, etc.


\subsection{Copyright}

Before AIAA can publish any paper, the copyright information must be completed in ScholarOne. Failure to complete the form correctly could result in your paper not being published. You must select one copyright assignment statement (select A, B, C, or D) and once a statement is picked, changes cannot be made during the proofs stage. Read the copyright statements carefully. AIAA requires a copyright transfer from the author(s) to AIAA or a license to print your material; government authors can assert that the work is in the public domain. Because you will be completing this form online, you do not need to fill out a hard-copy form. Do not include a copyright statement anywhere on your paper. The correct statement will be included automatically at the time of processing. (If your paper was presented at an AIAA conference, then the copyright statement chosen for the journal article should be the same as for your conference paper.)

\subsection{Publication Charges for Open Access}

Publication charges are voluntary, and nonpayment has no influence on the review process of the time from acceptance to publication. The article publication charge for immediate Open Access is available in ScholarOne and on the AIAA website; the fee is the same regardless of article type.
