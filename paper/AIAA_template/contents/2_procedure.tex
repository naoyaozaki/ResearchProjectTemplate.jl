\section{Procedure for Paper Submission}

All manuscripts are to be submitted to ScholarOne online at \url{https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/aiaa}. Select either “Log In” if you have an existing account or “Create an Account” if this is your first time submitting to one of AIAA’s journals. If it’s the latter, please follow the instructions ScholarOne provides. Once you have logged into ScholarOne, select “Author Center” then scroll down. Under “Author Resources”, select the star beside “Click here to submit a new manuscript”. The site will take you step-by-step through the submission process. Once you submit your manuscript, you will receive an email containing your manuscript ID number as well as a link to view the status of your manuscript. 

After entering all required submission data, you must use the “Upload Manuscript” feature of the Author Center to upload your submission. Remember that your document must be in single-column, double-spaced format (as this template) before you upload it. Please be sure that the name of the file you upload for processing is short and simple (i.e., “SmithJPP.pdf”) with no spaces, tildes, symbols, or other special characters. Authors are encouraged to upload .pdf files, which are less likely to have conversion errors on upload. Failure to meet these requirements could result in a processing error that would require you to re-upload your manuscript. Once you have uploaded your manuscript, please inspect the file for accuracy. This step is required to complete your submission. If you experience difficulties with the upload and/or conversion of your manuscript, please contact ScholarOne Manuscripts Support (\url{https://mchelp.manuscriptcentral.com/gethelpnow/} or +1-888-503-1050) for additional assistance. 

\emph{Attention Asian Authors: If you are uploading a .pdf file, please remove Asian fonts from your file, under File>Properties.}
