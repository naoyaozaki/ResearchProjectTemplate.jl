\section*{Appendix}

An Appendix, if needed, appears \textbf{before} research funding information and other acknowledgments.

\section*{Funding Sources}

Sponsorship information and acknowledgments of financial support should be included here. \textbf{Authors are responsible for accurately reporting funding data relevant to their research.} Please confirm that you have correctly entered \textbf{all sources} of funding and grant/award numbers \textbf{for all authors} in this section of your article. You will also be asked to select the appropriate funding organization from a drop-down menu in ScholarOne when you submit your manuscript. Be careful to choose the correct funder name, as organization names can be similar, and also be mindful to select sub-organizations within the registry hierarchy that are the actual funding sources, as appropriate, rather than choosing the name of the parent organization. Information provided in your manuscript must match the funding data entered in ScholarOne.

\section*{Acknowledgments}
An Acknowledgments section, if used, \textbf{immediately precedes} the References. Individuals other than the authors who contributed to the underlying research may be acknowledged in this section. The use of special facilities and other resources also may be acknowledged. If AI is used in the writing process or figure construction as permitted, authors must include a brief description of AI use in the Acknowledgments section of the manuscript.
