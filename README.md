# ResearchProjectTemplate.jl
The program environment is built within a Julia project, research notes and programs are compiled in Jupyter Notebooks, research task lists are managed via GitHub Issues, and papers are progressed using Overleaf. This repository serves as an example of a GitHub repository for managing all of these collectively. Since everything is managed in a single GitHub repository, GitHub Copilot has access to all the information.

## For LaTeX
Add the following extensions to VScode:
- Overleaf Workshop
- LaTeX Workshop

In Overleaf Workshop, select “Open Project Locally...” and specify the local directory where you cloned this GitHub repository. This allows you to use Overleaf while synchronizing it with your local directory.
